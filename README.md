#### Final Project: Encryption Options for MySQL and MongoDB Data at Rest
MySQL and MongoDB use different strategies for data encryption at rest. Enterprise MySQL and MongoDB provide encryption resource services (but with cost). Individual field encryption in MySQL GPL Workbench is easier than in MongoDB Community Edition. Provide three simulations: (1) Turn on SSL encryption and test connection between client and server, (2) Encrypt individual fields with AES and MD5, (3) MongoDB individual field encryption.
